### Hi there 👋 I'm Louis Forestier, aka Ghalaodh#1086 on Discord.

I'm a first year student in a Master's degree in Computer Science, and I'm looking to specialize in graphic programming. 

## 🌱 I’m currently studying Graphic programming.
I already have some knowledge in OpenGL and I'm getting my first hands on Vulkan.
I am also interested in VR and AR. I was able to develop some Virtual Reality applications on Unity for MetaQuest 2, I would now like to discover augmented reality.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on VR app at <a href="https://www.serli.com/">SERLI</a>.
I was able to use my knowledge of Unity and MetaQuest for this project. For now, we are studying the possibilities of a native application in C++ with OpenXR and OpenGL.
