# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Louis Forestier, aka ghalaodh on Discord.

I'm a second year student in a Master's degree in Computer Science, and I'm looking to specialize in graphic programming. 

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Graphic programming.
I already have some knowledge in OpenGL and I'm getting my first hands on Vulkan.
I am also interested in VR and AR. I was able to develop some Virtual Reality applications on Unity for MetaQuest 2.

## ðŸ”­ I'm in apprenticeship at Thales AVS, working on the 3D engine used in aircraft simulation.
It allows me to gain knowledge and skills in C++ and 3d engine programming.
On the side, I also work on a personal project to discover the Vulkan API and some rendering methods.
